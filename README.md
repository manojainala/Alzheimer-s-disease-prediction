Alzheimer's Disease (AD), is an irreparable brain disease, impairs thinking and memory while the aggregate mind size shrinks which at last prompts demise. Early diagnosis of AD is essential for the progress of more prevailing treatments. Using machine learning (ML), this disease can be predicted early by using different attribute of the disease. As a result of using ML in the medical field, this dementia has been noticed early and be diagnosed easily.

This research study addresses the problems of how we can early diagnose the Alzhiemers Disease. The methodology for solving this problem comprises data pre-processing, and classification of the impairments with the use of different classification algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression, LightGBM (LGBM). A system development has been made by taking LightGBM where it gave the best accuracy of 89.3%. The model is built in a way that the impairment is classified into 4 different classes No Impairment, Impairment, Mild Impairment, and Severe Impairment. This system is very helpful for the physicians where they can easily detect about the level of disease and can treat the patients according to the level of impairments.
